# SONIC1ENGINEBRANCH
(optimized) sonic 1 engine branch for whatever purpose (PLANNED TO BE USED FOR SONIC 1 BUT BETTER)

if anyone's seeing this, focus on the zip file. it'll get updated every week hopefully. the files currently outside of the zips are the scrapped upload of every single file in the disassembly, don't mind it. i'll delete it later
